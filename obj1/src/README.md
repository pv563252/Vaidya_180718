# Data Integrity

Using a modified version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, produced by the University of Michigan - the code provided in the /code directory establishes multiple tests for Data Integrity Checks.


## Data Integrity

Given the dataset, the most important data integrity questions to ask the dataset are:

* _Is the Dataset missing values? How were the missing values dealt with?_
* _Is the Dataset Randomized, or is it Biased in a particular Way?_
* _Are the features in the dataset independent of each other, or what part of the dataset is useful for the analysis?_
